The individual collections are available via separate tabs on: [https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/](https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/) 

## Editing Process

Just open a PR modifying the [JSON file](https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-VWAD/tree/master/src/data).

Please keep the file sorted by `name`. You can use this online tool to assist you: https://codeshack.io/json-sorter/. Entries should conform to the [schema](https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-VWAD/blob/master/schema.json) and are validated automatically during PR handling. You can also use this [online service](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) to check before submitting.

Since 20200331 they are automatically copied/deployed to the `www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory` repo, from which they are rendered on the owasp.org website.
